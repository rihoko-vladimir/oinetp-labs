All Macs in production use ARM-based Apple silicon processors. Apple silicon Macs have been praised for their performance and power efficiency.[171] They can run Intel apps through the Rosetta 2 translation layer, as well as iOS and iPadOS apps distributed via the App Store.[172] These Mac models come equipped with high-speed Thunderbolt 4 or USB 4 connectivity, with speeds up to 40Gbit/s.[173][174] Apple silicon Macs have custom integrated graphics rather than graphics cards.[175] MacBooks are recharged with either USB-C or MagSafe connectors, depending on the model.[176]
